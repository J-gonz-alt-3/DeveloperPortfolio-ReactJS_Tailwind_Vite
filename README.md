# Expectations coming into this

This next project is a big one, but one that I wanted to hold off on until I had other projects already completed so that I could add them onto here!

So, this project will be my very own personal/professional site where I will be displaying all of my projects and past work experience/journey.

# Tools used in this Project

- Javascript
- React
- Tailwind
- Vite
- Hostinger

# Project Afterthoughts

So, I did complete the project, however I may go back and fix a couple functionally aspects of it here and there from time to time.

Right now, I'm a bit frustrated with the Contact button, so I think I'll start there as far as fixing it.

But aside from that everything else is pretty decent.

# Cool Project Features

So what's really cool about this portfolio is the little Sun/Moon icon I have on the top right of the screen that will toggle Light/Dark Mode for my Portfolio.

Go ahead and press it and see how it works!

I'm really proud of this project because it's the first project I've created on my GitHub that is about me and not just a project to test my skills (not caring about the site data).
