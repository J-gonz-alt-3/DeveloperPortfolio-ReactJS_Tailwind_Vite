# Expectations coming into this project

This next project is a big one, but one that I wanted to hold off on until I had other projects already completed so that I could display them here!

So, this project is my very own personal/professional site where I will be displaying all of my projects and past work experience/journey.

# Tools used in this Project

- Javascript
- React
- Tailwind
- Vite
- Hostinger

# Cool Project Features

So what's really cool about this portfolio is the little Sun icon I have on the top right of the screen that will toggle Light/Dark Mode for my Portfolio.

Go ahead and press it and see how it works!

I also created a Workflow for this project using GitHub so that any changes I make to the file in my local_repo, I just have to push it to my remote_repo and the GitHub workflow will compile a Build which is then used by Hostinger to display the most current src code for my Portfolio! 

# Project Afterthoughts

This project is complete, however I will be editing the src folder, specifically the timeline.js file with any new updates/typo fixes I find!

I was a bit frustrated with the Contact button upon project completion, but after some code review I discovered I set the button type to "button" instead of its default value of "submit". This caused the button to do nothing upon someone clicking it, which is NOT what I wanted. I want users to view my portfolio and send me an email using the Contact Section of the page. (It works now so feel free to Contact Me!).

But aside from that everything else is pretty decent.
